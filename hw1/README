Using Linux/g++
FindRoute Compilation and Run instructions
Dennis Cornwell - CSE841 - 9/29/13

Compiling:
1. Download all source files into the same directory (referred to as the 'root directory')
   1.1 Source files include:
   	 - findRoute.cpp
   	 - city.h
   	 - city.cpp
   	 - connection.h
   	 - connection_comparator.h
   	 - Makefile
   	 - cities.txt // loaded by the program on startup
   	 - flightCharges.txt // loaded by the program on startup
2. Run make in this directory
	2.1 Note that a bin/ directory will be generated, but the final binary file will be created in
		 the root directory.
	2.2 Running the target 'clean' will remove all binary files including the findRoute program.

Running:
1. From the root directory, run findRoute with the two integer city IDs and a floating point cost/hour value.
	1.1 Example: ./findRoute 2 3 17.50
